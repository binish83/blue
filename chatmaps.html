						<br><br><h3>Let's design your user expereinces together!</h3><br>
							<p>Hello, I'm Binish! I am a UX designer. Currently, a UX/UI Team Lead at Lambda School, managing a team of 6 junior UX designer. I love UX design because I get to put forward my top skill of empathy to take complicated tasks and make it simple to understand. UX Design is about understanding the environment, learning about the behaviors of the users, and finally analyzing that knowledge and building relations with shared values.</p>
							
							<p>Good teachers are inherently empathetic and cherish it every day. My background as a teacher allowed me to exercise UX Concepts in a creative learning space. During the four years of experience in establishing relationships between the end-user (student), parents (stakeholder) and the product (lessons), my focus has been to create an engaging experience for learning difficult concepts in a pleasurable way.</p>
							 
							<p>Most of my work involved researching the different learning styles and building the persona for each type of student. My research enabled me to tailor my instructions to meet the needs of each student. Immediate feedback from students facial expressions of boredom had me on my toes to iterate my lessons on the spot to regain the spark.  In terms of real-life experience in building user empathy, doing research, and creating a simple environment, I have incorporated the UX Design skills at various levels.</p>
							
							<p>My curiosity and eagerness to learn led me to Lambda School, where I learned the most knowledge about UX Design. It was a fantastic program where I put in a lot of hard work to get to where I am today.</p>
							 
							<p>When I am not thinking about design, I am creating engaging experiences for my three pirates â€” guiding them in finding the real treasures of life. </p>
							 
							<p>In the hustle-bustle of pirates taking over my ship, I still find time to meditate by relaxing myself to some yoga time.</p>
							 
							<p>I love Saturday mornings when I sneak out of my motherboard and go on a hike. Or, ride my bike through the trails of wilderness to find peace and my connection with nature. </p>
							
							<p>My mantra of a happy life is being simple yet filled with adventures. </p>
