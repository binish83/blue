                How can we build a bridge between physical connection and digital connection based on location?
                <p>
                    Location Chat was a 2 month-long project where we . . . The team consisted of myself, a project
                    manager, and five developers. We completed the native app back in August 2019.
                </p>
                <h3>The Problem</h3>
                <p>People exist digitally but there is no way to meet someone at an event or the same place as you are?
                    This Application could be a way to merge them both. Location chat wants to build a bridge from the
                    digital world and the real world.To give the opportunity to meet and learn from people in your
                    current location or event. People are uncomfortable with face to face interaction. We need to
                    Eliminate the initial awkwardness of in-person interaction.</p>

                <h3>Design Thinking</h3>
                <p>
                    In order to take a solution-based approach to solving the problem, I created a design process that
                    revolved around my users. Since they were the end users, including them in the design thinking was
                    in the best interest of everyone at stake. This process helped me observe and develop empathy with
                    our target audience. The following diagram shows the steps taken in each phase of the project.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    Stakeholder Interview
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I made it a priority to schedule a meeting with the stakeholders as soon as possible. This step was
                    extremely important to better understand the business so I could set the boundaries of the design
                    project. I needed to define the goals and objectives and most importantly learn about the
                    assumptions being made about the user. Understanding their business needs would give me insights and
                    empathy to find ways to create a user experience.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    User Research
                </h3>
                <p>
                    After I uncovered the business objectives and goals, it was time to take out my curious detective
                    hat and gain a clear understanding of the problem I was going to solve. I wanted to envision exactly
                    what I was about to design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So Why do people allow apps to access location data? I pulled a demographic data analysis to help us
                    sort our research.

                <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>

                <p>We wanted to personalize usersâ€™ experiences with a location chat app or feature that most smartphone
                    owners will appreciate. My main focus was to look into web/mobile messaging portal that
                    automatically puts people in an anonymous chat rooms based on their geographical proximity, or
                    something along those lines.</p>

                <ul class="list">
                    <li>
                        What other companies are providing a similar platform?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        What are they doing successful?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        What is not so great about the app?
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Early Sketches</h3>
                <p>Sketches are an important part of the design and development process. I wanted to demonstrate
                    functionality, visualize the user flow and illustrate anything that would require human interaction.
                    This step really helped me discover potential issues and solutions early, prior to starting the
                    design and development stage. I tested out the sketches with 1-2 users before I moved on to
                    wireframes.</p>

                <h4>Iteration for Android:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li> What other companies are providing a similar platform?</li>
                    <li> What are they doing successful?</li>
                    <li> What is not so great about the app?</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="images/Android Sketch.jpg" class="img-responsive center" alt="">

                <h4>Wireframes</h4>
                <p>Wireframes is my favorite part, This is the part where the ideas from sketching got more refined and moved a step closer to the finer details of a user interface for location chat. I used Sketch to build the skeleton of the application. My goal was to focus on figuring out the layout and content placement, and solving navigation and functionality issues in a more simple and easy to use way.</p>

                <h3>Moodboard</h3>
                <p>
                    The big question what should be the color theme for this project? I took the approach of visualization to inspiration. By visualizing the look and feel of color interacting together extremely helped me, to jump-start the design process. With the color mood board complete, I had a clear vision of the color scheme to create the hi-fidelity designs with confidence.

                <h4>
                    User Flows
                </h4>
                <p>
                    In order to figure out what it will take for a user to complete a specific task on this location chat I created a visualization of each step. The user flow really helped me to document user interaction points and communicate the design process effectively with stakeholders and developers. When presenting the user flow to the team, I focused more on the experience and the needs of the user to support the features and the functionalities of the application.
