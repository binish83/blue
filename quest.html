				<h1 class="lowercase">Sociable Challenge Platform</h1>
				<h3>How do we encourage members to go out and seek new experiences?</h3>
				<br><p>Quest for the best was a 5 day sprint as a UX student at Lambda School. My role as UX Designer/UX Researcher on the project made it a priority to work very closely with the stakeholder to build a usable and simple prototype. I researched, designed and tested all UI’s related to launch the project.</p>

			<!--The Problem-->	
				<h3 class="black font-weight-bolder">👩🏻‍⚕️ What seems to be the problem?  </h3>
				<p>There is a need to remove the pain of exploring new places without wasting time and money. People need to get out of their comfort zone and explore a variety of life events. Not many people are going out of their way to add variety into their lives. Stakeholder’s want to promote finding interesting experiences collectively as a group. Create a challenging platform and allow the users to discover new quests and share them with the community.</p>

			<!--Design Process-->
				<h3 class="black font-weight-bolder">👩🏻‍🏫️ So, What's the plan?  </h3>
				<p>Well, It was crucial to assign the right amount of time to each tasks, so that I would be able to gain more time. With the clock ticking, I didn't have a team to implement a design sprint 2.0, and I didn't have the time to complete the entire product design cycle. So I decided to roll up my sleeves and do a hybrid version. <br> <br> Basically pick and choose the steps that would best solve the problem in 5 days. I conducted a stakeholder interview and the 'How Might We's' the Friday before the sprint to get a good understanding of the business goals and objectives.</p>

			<!--Research & Explorations-->	
				<h3 class="black font-weight-bolder">🕵🏻‍♀️️ What are you going to do about it?  </h3>
				<p>I had a day to explore and research different ways a poll app can fundtion and to seek out the best existing apps. There were existing poll apps conducting similar tasks, so I conducted research on the top 3 most relevant competitors. Research helped me finalize the color pallete for the application. <br> <br> Purple combines the calm stability of blue and the fierce energy of red. The more relaxed a user is, the more they would likely to remember the details of past expereinces and share it with the community. <br> <br> During the user research process, I came to the conclusion on how important it has become for people to check reviews and feedback of products, experiences and restaurants before trying it out themselves. This helps prevent a user from having a bad experience

				<blockquote class="ludwig">“This is a general tendency for everyone,” said Clifford Nass, a professor of communication at Stanford University. “Almost everyone remembers negative things more strongly and in more detail.”

			<!--Early Sketches & Ideas-->	
			
				<h3 class="black font-weight-bolder mt-5">👩🏻‍🎨 Initial ideas & sketches  </h3>	
				
					<p>I started to think through the structure of screens. I used pencil/paper and whimsical to sketch possible ideas. After I picked the best designs for each features  I used Sketch to create low-fidelity mockups to iterate through the design process to find the best solution.</p>

			<!--Wireframes-->	
				<h3 class="black font-weight-bolder mt-5">🤔 Refining ideas </h3>
				<p>Wireframes is my favorite part, This is the part where the ideas from sketching got more refined and moved a step closer to the finer details of a user interface for location chat. I used Sketch to build the skeleton of the application. My goal was to focus on figuring out the layout and content placement, and solving navigation and functionality issues in a more simple and easy to use way.</p>

			<!--User Flows-->	
				<h3 class="black font-weight-bolder mt-5">🎯 Setting the direction </h3>
				<p>In order to figure out what it will take for a user to complete a specific task on this location chat I created a visualization of each step. The user flow really helped me to document user interaction points and communicate the design process effectively with stakeholders and developers. When presenting the user flow to the team, I focused more on the experience and the needs of the user to support the features and the functionalities of the application.</p>

			<!--Color Purple-->	
				<h3 class="black font-weight-bolder mt-5">👿 First impression of purple? </h3>
				<p>According to the study of color psychology purple is  Associated with wisdom, independence and mystery. It fit perfectly with the concept of seeking quests and challenges of trying out new experiences. Physically, purple can have calming effects over the mind and nerves leading to an accurate rating of a past experience. It would remove any overwhelming effects of using a new app and deliver quality reviews of user experiences. </p>

			<!--Preference Test-->	
				<h3 class="black font-weight-bolder mt-5">😀 Happy users mean more usability</h3>
				<p>Happier Users means more customers, I decided to understand what part of the design makes a happy or frustrated user by conducting several feature testing on usabilityhub.com and 5 in-person interviews. I wanted to know exactly what type of questions prompted accurate feedback from users. </p>
				<img src="images/Q4B Preference Test.jpg" class="center rounded" alt="">
				
			<!--Challenges-->		
				<h3 class="black font-weight-bolder mt-5">👩🏻‍🔬 Challenges </h3>
				<p>During testing, I went through several different design concepts that ultimately did not completely satisfy the user needs. The rating experience concept that I prototyped caused the user to rate the experience inaccurately. I saw that multiple choice with just text influenced the user to give negative feedback. I ran the same test with the use of emojis and sliders, The feedback was positive one and users were able to think back a time where they went to a good restaurant and gave the feedback necessary for the quest results to get logged in the dashboard. According to my research Clifford Nass said human remembers the bad experiences more.</p>

			<!--Final Designs-->	
				<h3 class="black font-weight-bolder mt-5" >👩🏻‍💻 Final Designs  </h3>
				<p>Design is worth a thousand words and I wanted to know what those were! So I had users test out my invision high-fidelity prototype and tell me exactly what their thoughts were.</p>
				<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/ie7QU4OzC5R8OGTDon/giphy.gif" class="center rounded-lg" style="width:300px; height:auto;" alt="">
			<!--Final Designs-->	
				<h3 class="black font-weight-bolder mt-5" > 💁🏻 How the project affected the users?</h3>
				<p>Design is worth a thousand words and I wanted to know what those were! So I had users test out my invision high-fidelity prototype and tell me exactly what their thoughts were. It is easy to think of a bad experience and give review, However the final designs documented best experiences which will help solve the problem of making people get out of the comfort zone and try out</p>

			<!--Challenges-->		
				<h3 class="black font-weight-bolder mt-5">🔑 Key Takeaways </h3>
				<p>	I learned that if people will be overwhelmed by the design of the application, it will result in an inaccurate feedback in polls, which is the bread and butter of the app.  <br><br>
				
				This project had its own set of challenges but a few were to creating the most effective way of rating the experience was crucial to ensure that the feedback was accurate. The same emotions had to be recreated to reflect the actual experience and of course not to mention working with the color purple 😉 <br> <br>
				
				The whole project was a huge learning experience from <b class="black">design thinking</b>, <b class="black">iterating</b>  and <b class="black">testing</b>  the improved designs. This process helped take the ambiguity out of the designs, and it felt good to produce a design that user will actually enjoy using.
